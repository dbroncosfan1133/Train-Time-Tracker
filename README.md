# Train-Time-Tracker

This was homework assignment that used Firebase and Moment.js to allow trains to be stored based on Name, destination, first departure, and time between stops.  The next arrival time is calculated based off the first departure time and time between stops.  Minutes away is calculated on the next arrival time and the current (real time).
